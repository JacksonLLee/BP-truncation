# Modeling truncation in Brazilian Portuguese

By [Mike Pham](http://www.mikettpham.com/) and [Jackson Lee](http://jacksonllee.com/)

A full paper is currently being prepared,
which is a substantically expanded and revised version of the brief write-up
as a
[technical report (TR-2014-15, UChicago Computer Science)](https://newtraell.cs.uchicago.edu/research/publications/techreports/TR-2014-15).

## Contents

- ``main.py``: Python script for running the different truncation models over the data files in the ``data/`` folder

- ``data/``:

    * ``pt_br_orthofix*``: Brazilian Portuguese lexicon (two versions)
    * gold standard nouns with attested truncation (available in various formats for different annotations regarding binary foot model predictions)

- ``plots_words/``: output plots for individual words for log(left-complete counts) and log(right-complete counts)

- ``plots_errors/``: output plots of error distributions

- ``outlatex*``: sameple output LaTeX files

- ``output*``: sample CSV output file

- ``plots*``: sample output R scripts

- ``readme.md``: this readme file


## Usage

Download this repository to your local drive by one of these two methods:

* Download and unzip https://github.com/JacksonLLee/BP-truncation/archive/master.zip

* Clone this repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/JacksonLLee/BP-truncation.git
    $ cd BP-truncation

After this repository is downloaded, run the truncation models for the accompanying datasets:

    $ python3 main.py

``main.py`` works on Python 3.x (not Python 2). Once this script is run, you will be prompted to provide several parameters. These parameters have to do with which input datasets you would like to use. The sample output files included in this repository are generated by the following parameters (note the answers in bold):

- Treat -a in TF as part of TS (maximal symbol overlap)? Y/N **N**

- Include technical terms? Y/N **N**

- Orthography system: k or c? **k**

## Output files

Once this Python script is run and the input dataset parameters are provided,
output files ``outlatex*`` (LaTeX output), ``output*`` (CSV output), and ``plots*`` (R scripts) are generated at the same directory. In addition, output plots of interest are in the subdirectories ``plots_words/`` and ``plots_errors/``.

*LaTeX and R outputs:*

If you are on a Unix-like system (Linux or Mac)
and the command line path environment recognizes
the commands ``xelatex`` and ``Rscript``,
then the generated ``.tex`` will be compiled and the ``.R`` file will be run by R.
If you are on Windows or if for other reasons the commands ``xelatex`` and ``Rscript``
are unavailable, then ``.tex`` and ``.R`` can be run by other non-command line means of your choice.
